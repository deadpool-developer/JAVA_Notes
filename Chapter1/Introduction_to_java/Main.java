// A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in directory
package Chapter1.Introduction_to_java;

//Name of class is Main because file ka name bhi Main hai
public class Main {

    //The main method is the entry point of the application
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // void means no value is returned
        // main is the name of the function
        // public is the access modifier -> can be accessed from any place
        // static means that we can run the function of the class without making its object

	// write your code here
        System.out.print("Hello World!!");

    }
}

//NOTES

/*
1.The basic structure of the java program contain -:
    i. Functions : Take it an example of Plumber, If we want to get repair something than we call the plumber and our thing gets fixed.
    ii. Classes : Take an example of household repair, We want many things to get repair in our house so different objects or persons is called to get the things fixed.
            |
            Grouping of similar objects

/*
2.  Naming Conventions
        i. For classes, we use Pascal Convention -> First letter will be capital -> MyNameIsAditya
        ii. For Functions, we use camelCaseConvention -> myNameIsAditya
